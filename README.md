# Load Forecasting using the Regression Method

# Overview
This project aims to forecast the electric load in Slovakia using regression methods. It utilizes a dataset containing historical electric load data for accurate predictions. The MATLAB code provided implements various regression techniques to analyze the data and generate forecasts.

# Files Included

## 1. Dataset
- **`slovakia_electric_load.csv`**: This file contains the historical electric load data for Slovakia, including timestamps and corresponding load values. The dataset is essential for training and testing the forecasting model.

## 2. MATLAB Code
- **`load_forecasting.m`**: This MATLAB script implements the load forecasting using regression methods. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The code is well-commented to help you understand each step of the process.

# How to Use
1. Download the repository and ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Load the dataset in MATLAB using the provided script.
3. Follow the comments in the `load_forecasting.m` file to run the regression analysis and view the results.
